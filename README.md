# intermine-ws-python-docs
#### Tutorials for the InterMine Python web client

This repository comprises of tutorials to help you get familiarised with the intermine-python package. The tutorials are in the form of Jupyter-Notebooks. You can either install Jupyter on your machine, download the tutorials and then run them on your local machine or you can use Jupyter's notebook viewer facility to view the tutorials online. 
You can find the NBViewer service at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

If you already have python installed on your machine, you can pip install Jupyter. If you do not have Python on your machine, you can download and install Anaconda as it would install Python along with Jupyter and many other packages.
