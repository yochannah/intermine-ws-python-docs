The authors found that each of the bang-sensitive mutants described in this paper (bas, bss, eas, and tko) also displayed similar behavioral repertoires upon exposure to either high or low temperature. These repertoires are composed of interspersed periods of seizure and paralysis, and appear to have interesting parallels with vertebrate epileptiform behavior. Analysis of gynandromorph mosaics of these bang-sensitive mutant flies indicated that anatomical foci required for these two types of behaviors do not totally overlap, as they were separable among mosaic flies. Observations on mosaic and decapitated flies demonstrated an all-or-none expression of the seizure-and-paralysis behaviors, indicating global activity and long-range interactions in the nervous system.

      "Gene: publications.abstractText='\"Regulatory evolution,\"that is, changes in a gene\\'s expression pattern through changes at its regulatory sequence, rather than changes at thecoding sequence of the gene or changes of the upstream transcription factors, has been increasingly recognized as a pervasive evolution mechanism. Many somatic sexually dimorphic features of Drosophila melanogaster are the results of gene expression regulated by the doublesex (dsx) gene, which encodes sex-specific transcription factors (DSX(F) in females and DSX(M) in males). Rapid changes in such sexually dimorphic features are likely a result of changes at the regulatory sequence of the target genes. We focused on the Flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (Fmo-2) gene, a likely direct dsx target, to elucidate how sexually dimorphic expression and its evolution are brought about. We found that dsx is deployed to regulate the Fmo-2 transcription both in the midgut and in fat body cells of the spermatheca (a female-specific tissue), through a canonical DSX-binding site in the Fmo-2 regulatory sequence. In the melanogaster group, Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut has evolved rapidly, in contrast to the conserved spermathecal transcription. We identified two cis-regulatory modules (CRM-p and CRM-d) that direct sexually monomorphic or dimorphic Fmo-2 transcription, respectively, in the midguts of these species. Changes of Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut from sexually dimorphic to sexually monomorphic in some species are caused by the loss of CRM-d function, but not the loss of the canonical DSX-binding site. Thus, conferring transcriptional regulation on a CRM level allows the regulation to evolve rapidly in one tissue while evading evolutionary constraints posed by other tissues.' publications.doi='10.1073/pnas.1501192112' publications.firstAuthor='Luo Shengzhan D' publications.id=1026760 publications.issue='8' publications.journal='Proc.

Autophagy operates at basal levels in all cells where it serves as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cellular integrity. The levels and cargoes of autophagy can, however, change in response to a variety of stimuli, and perturbations in autophagy are known to be involved in the aetiology of various human diseases. Autophagy must therefore be tightly controlled. We report here that the Drosophila cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE is a modulator of autophagy. Loss of the human PITSLRE orthologue, CDK11, initially appears to induce autophagy, but at later time points CDK11 is critically required for autophagic flux and cargo digestion.

Understanding biological functions of 14-3-3 proteins has been limited by the functional redundancy of conservedisotypes. Here we provide evidence that 14-3-3 proteins regulate two interacting components of Tor signalling in Drosophila, translationally controlled tumour protein (Tctp) and Rheb GTPase. Single knockdown of 14-3-3ɛ or 14-3-3ζ isoform does not show obvious defects in organ development but causes synergistic genetic interaction with Tctp and Rheb to impair tissue growth. 14-3-3 proteins physically interact with Tctp and Rheb. Knockdown of both 14-3-3 isoforms abolishes the binding between Tctp and Rheb, disrupting organ development. Depletion of 14-3-3s also reduces the level of phosphorylated S6 kinase, phosphorylated Thor/4E-BP and cyclin E (CycE).

Recently, two proteins, a calponin-like Chd64 and immunophilin FKBP39 have been found to play a pivotal role in the cross-talk between 20E and JH, although the molecular basis of interaction remains unknown. The aim of this work was to identify the structural features that would provide understanding of the role of Chd64 in multiple and dynamic complex that cross-links the signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate the results of in silico and in vitro analyses of the structural organization of Chd64 from Drosophila melanogaster and its homologue from Tribolium castaneum. Computational analysis predicted the existence of disordered regions on the termini of both proteins, while the central region appeared to be globular, probably corresponding to the calponin homology (CH) domain. In vitro analyses of the hydrodynamic properties of the proteins from analytical size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that DmChd64 and TcChd64 had an asymmetrical, elongated shape, which was further confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The Kratky plot indicated disorderness in both Chd64 proteins, which could possibly be on the protein termini and which would give rise to specific hydrodynamic properties. Disordered tails are often involved in diverse interactions. Therefore, it is highly possible that there are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) on both termini of the Chd64 proteins that serve as platforms for multiple interaction with various partners and constitute the foundation for their regulatory function.' publications.doi='10.1371/journal.pone.0096809' publications.firstAuthor='Kozłowska Małgorzata' publications.id=4804711 publications.issue='5' publications.journal='PLoS ONE' publications.month=None publications.pages='e96809' publications.pubMedId='24805353' publications.title='Calponin-like Chd64 is partly disordered.' publications.volume='9' publications.year=2014\n",
      "Gene: publications.abstractText=\"3'-End cleavage of animal replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs is controlled by the U7 snRNP. Lsm11, the largest component of the U7-specific Sm ring, interacts with FLASH, and in mammalian nuclear extracts these two proteins form a platform that recruits the CPSF73 endonuclease and other polyadenylation factors to the U7 snRNP. FLASH is limiting, and the majority of the U7 snRNP in mammalian extracts exists as a core particle consisting of the U7 snRNA and the Sm ring. Here, we purified the U7 snRNP from Drosophila nuclear extracts and characterized its composition by mass spectrometry. In contrast to the mammalian U7 snRNP, a significant fraction of the Drosophila U7 snRNP contains endogenous FLASH and at least six subunits of the polyadenylation machinery: symplekin, CPSF73, CPSF100, CPSF160, WDR33, and CstF64. The same composite U7 snRNP is recruited to histone pre-mRNA for 3'-end processing. We identified a motif in Drosophila FLASH that is essential for the recruitment of the polyadenylation complex to the U7 snRNP and analyzed the role of other factors, including SLBP and Ars2, in 3'-end processing of Drosophila histone pre-mRNAs. SLBP that binds the upstream stem-loop structure likely recruits a yet-unidentified essential component(s) to the processing machinery. In contrast, Ars2, a protein previously shown to interact with FLASH in mammalian cells, is dispensable for processing in Drosophila.

Physiologically, DDC is responsible for the production of dopamine and serotonin through the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophan, respectively. In insects, both dopamine and serotonin serve as classical neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or neurohormones, and dopamine is also involved in insect cuticle formation, eggshell hardening, and immune responses. In this study, we expressed a typical DDC enzyme from Drosophila melanogaster, critically analyzed its substrate specificity and biochemical properties, determined its crystal structure at 1.75 Angstrom resolution, and evaluated the roles residues T82 and H192 play in substrate binding and enzyme catalysis through site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme. Our results establish that this DDC functions exclusively on the production of dopamine and serotonin, with no activity to tyrosine or tryptophan and catalyzes the formation of serotonin more efficiently than dopamine. The crystal structure of Drosophila DDC and the site-directed mutagenesis study of the enzyme demonstrate that T82 is involved in substrate binding and that H192 is used not only for substrate interaction, but for cofactor binding of drDDC as well.

Although, several studies have reported the ovotoxicity of VCH, information on a possible involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of this occupational chemical is scarce. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate further possible mechanisms of toxicity of VCH with a specific emphasis on oxidative stress using a Drosophila melanogaster model. D. melanogaster (both genders) of 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different concentrations of VCH (10 µM-1 mM) in the diet for 5 days. Subsequently, the survival and negative geotaxis assays and the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined. In addition, we evaluated RT-PCR expressions of selected oxidative stress and antioxidant mRNA genes (HSP27, 70, and 83, SOD, Nrf-2, MAPK2, and catalase). Furthermore, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined. VCH exposure impaired negative geotaxic behavior and induced the mRNA of SOD, Nrf-2, and MAPK2 genes expressions. There were increases in catalase and ROS production, as well as inhibitions of GST, δ-ALA-D, and AChE activities (P<0.05). Our results suggest that the VCH mechanism of toxicity is associated with oxidative damage, as evidenced by the alteration in the oxidative stress-antioxidant balance, and possible neurotoxic consequences due to decreased AChE activity, and impairments in negative geotaxic behavior. Thus, we conclude that D. melanogaster is a useful model for investigating the toxicity of VCH exposure, and here, we have provided further insights on the mechanism of VCH-induced toxicity.' publications.doi='10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.03.014' publications.firstAuthor='Abolaji Amos Olalekan' publications.id=1164844 publications.issue=None publications.journal='Free Radic.

      "Gene: publications.abstractText=\"5'-nucleotidases catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates. As catabolic enzymes they contribute significantly to the regulation of cellular nucleotide levels; misregulation of nucleotide metabolism and nucleotidase deficiencies are associated with a number of diseases. The seven human 5'-nucleotidases differ with respect to substrate specificity and cellular localization. Recently, the novel cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase III-like protein, or cN-IIIB, has been characterized in human and Drosophila. cN-IIIB exhibits a strong substrate preference for the modified nucleotide 7-methylguanosine monophosphate but the structural reason for this preference was unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of cN-IIIB from Drosophila melanogaster bound to the reaction products 7-methylguanosine or cytidine. The structural data reveal that the cytosine- and 7-methylguanine moieties of the products are stacked between two aromatic residues in a coplanar but off-centered position. 7-methylguanosine is specifically bound through π-π interactions and distinguished from unmodified guanosine by additional cation-π coulomb interactions between the aromatic side chains and the positively charged 7-methylguanine. Notably, the base is further stabilized by T-shaped edge-to-face stacking of an additional tryptophan packing perpendicularly against the purine ring and forming, together with the other aromates, an aromatic slot. The structural data in combination with site-directed mutagenesis experiments reveal the molecular basis for the broad substrate specificity of cN-IIIB but also explain the substrate preference for 7-methylguanosine monophosphate. Analyzing the substrate specificities of cN-IIIB and the main pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase cN-IIIA by mutagenesis studies, we show that cN-IIIA dephosphorylates the purine m7GMP as well, hence redefining its substrate spectrum. Docking calculations with cN-IIIA and m7GMP as well as biochemical data reveal that Asn69 does not generally exclude the turnover of purine substrates thus correcting previous suggestions.\" publications.doi='10.1371/journal.pone.0090915' publications.firstAuthor='Monecke Thomas' publications.id=1988552 publications.issue='3' publications.journal='PLoS ONE' publications.month=None publications.pages='e90915' publications.pubMedId='24603684' publications.title=\"Crystal structures of the novel cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase IIIB explain its preference for m7GMP.\" publications.volume='9' publications.year=2014\n"

The authors found that each of the bang-sensitive mutants described in this paper (bas, bss, eas, and tko) also displayed similar behavioral repertoires upon exposure to either high or low temperature. These repertoires are composed of interspersed periods of seizure and paralysis, and appear to have interesting parallels with vertebrate epileptiform behavior. Analysis of gynandromorph mosaics of these bang-sensitive mutant flies indicated that anatomical foci required for these two types of behaviors do not totally overlap, as they were separable among mosaic flies. Observations on mosaic and decapitated flies demonstrated an all-or-none expression of the seizure-and-paralysis behaviors, indicating global activity and long-range interactions in the nervous system. Therefore, the diverse collection of currently available Drosophila bang-sensitive mutants may serve as a rich source for mutational and cellular analysis to identify interacting molecular networks that are responsible for seizure phenotypes.' publications.doi='10.3109/01677063.2012.690011' publications.firstAuthor='Burg Martin G' publications.id=3053827 publications.issue='2' publications.journal='J.

Many somatic sexually dimorphic features of Drosophila melanogaster are the results of gene expression regulated by the doublesex (dsx) gene, which encodes sex-specific transcription factors (DSX(F) in females and DSX(M) in males). Rapid changes in such sexually dimorphic features are likely a result of changes at the regulatory sequence of the target genes. We focused on the Flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (Fmo-2) gene, a likely direct dsx target, to elucidate how sexually dimorphic expression and its evolution are brought about. We found that dsx is deployed to regulate the Fmo-2 transcription both in the midgut and in fat body cells of the spermatheca (a female-specific tissue), through a canonical DSX-binding site in the Fmo-2 regulatory sequence. In the melanogaster group, Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut has evolved rapidly, in contrast to the conserved spermathecal transcription. We identified two cis-regulatory modules (CRM-p and CRM-d) that direct sexually monomorphic or dimorphic Fmo-2 transcription, respectively, in the midguts of these species. Changes of Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut from sexually dimorphic to sexually monomorphic in some species are caused by the loss of CRM-d function, but not the loss of the canonical DSX-binding site. Thus, conferring transcriptional regulation on a CRM level allows the regulation to evolve rapidly in one tissue while evading evolutionary constraints posed by other tissues.' publications.doi='10.1073/pnas.1501192112' publications.firstAuthor='Luo Shengzhan D' publications.id=1026760 publications.issue='8' publications.journal='Proc.

Autophagy operates at basal levels in all cells where it serves as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cellular integrity. The levels and cargoes of autophagy can, however, change in response to a variety of stimuli, and perturbations in autophagy are known to be involved in the aetiology of various human diseases. Autophagy must therefore be tightly controlled. We report here that the Drosophila cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE is a modulator of autophagy. Loss of the human PITSLRE orthologue, CDK11, initially appears to induce autophagy, but at later time points CDK11 is critically required for autophagic flux and cargo digestion.

Understanding biological functions of 14-3-3 proteins has been limited by the functional redundancy of conservedisotypes.

Single knockdown of 14-3-3ɛ or 14-3-3ζ isoform does not show obvious defects in organ development but causes synergistic genetic interaction with Tctp and Rheb to impair tissue growth. 14-3-3 proteins physically interact with Tctp and Rheb. Knockdown of both 14-3-3 isoforms abolishes the binding between Tctp and Rheb, disrupting organ development. Depletion of 14-3-3s also reduces the level of phosphorylated S6 kinase, phosphorylated Thor/4E-BP and cyclin E (CycE).

Recently, two proteins, a calponin-like Chd64 and immunophilin FKBP39 have been found to play a pivotal role in the cross-talk between 20E and JH, although the molecular basis of interaction remains unknown. The aim of this work was to identify the structural features that would provide understanding of the role of Chd64 in multiple and dynamic complex that cross-links the signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate the results of in silico and in vitro analyses of the structural organization of Chd64 from Drosophila melanogaster and its homologue from Tribolium castaneum. Computational analysis predicted the existence of disordered regions on the termini of both proteins, while the central region appeared to be globular, probably corresponding to the calponin homology (CH) domain. In vitro analyses of the hydrodynamic properties of the proteins from analytical size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that DmChd64 and TcChd64 had an asymmetrical, elongated shape, which was further confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The Kratky plot indicated disorderness in both Chd64 proteins, which could possibly be on the protein termini and which would give rise to specific hydrodynamic properties. Disordered tails are often involved in diverse interactions. Therefore, it is highly possible that there are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) on both termini of the Chd64 proteins that serve as platforms for multiple interaction with various partners and constitute the foundation for their regulatory function.' publications.doi='10.1371/journal.pone.0096809' publications.firstAuthor='Kozłowska Małgorzata' publications.id=4804711 publications.issue='5' publications.journal='PLoS ONE' publications.month=None publications.pages='e96809' publications.pubMedId='24805353' publications.title='Calponin-like Chd64 is partly disordered.' publications.volume='9' publications.year=2014\n",

Lsm11, the largest component of the U7-specific Sm ring, interacts with FLASH, and in mammalian nuclear extracts these two proteins form a platform that recruits the CPSF73 endonuclease and other polyadenylation factors to the U7 snRNP. FLASH is limiting, and the majority of the U7 snRNP in mammalian extracts exists as a core particle consisting of the U7 snRNA and the Sm ring. Here, we purified the U7 snRNP from Drosophila nuclear extracts and characterized its composition by mass spectrometry. In contrast to the mammalian U7 snRNP, a significant fraction of the Drosophila U7 snRNP contains endogenous FLASH and at least six subunits of the polyadenylation machinery: symplekin, CPSF73, CPSF100, CPSF160, WDR33, and CstF64. The same composite U7 snRNP is recruited to histone pre-mRNA for 3'-end processing. We identified a motif in Drosophila FLASH that is essential for the recruitment of the polyadenylation complex to the U7 snRNP and analyzed the role of other factors, including SLBP and Ars2, in 3'-end processing of Drosophila histone pre-mRNAs. SLBP that binds the upstream stem-loop structure likely recruits a yet-unidentified essential component(s) to the processing machinery. In contrast, Ars2, a protein previously shown to interact with FLASH in mammalian cells, is dispensable for processing in Drosophila.

In insects, both dopamine and serotonin serve as classical neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or neurohormones, and dopamine is also involved in insect cuticle formation, eggshell hardening, and immune responses. In this study, we expressed a typical DDC enzyme from Drosophila melanogaster, critically analyzed its substrate specificity and biochemical properties, determined its crystal structure at 1.75 Angstrom resolution, and evaluated the roles residues T82 and H192 play in substrate binding and enzyme catalysis through site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme. Our results establish that this DDC functions exclusively on the production of dopamine and serotonin, with no activity to tyrosine or tryptophan and catalyzes the formation of serotonin more efficiently than dopamine. The crystal structure of Drosophila DDC and the site-directed mutagenesis study of the enzyme demonstrate that T82 is involved in substrate binding and that H192 is used not only for substrate interaction, but for cofactor binding of drDDC as well.

Although, several studies have reported the ovotoxicity of VCH, information on a possible involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of this occupational chemical is scarce. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate further possible mechanisms of toxicity of VCH with a specific emphasis on oxidative stress using a Drosophila melanogaster model. D. melanogaster (both genders) of 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different concentrations of VCH (10 µM-1 mM) in the diet for 5 days. Subsequently, the survival and negative geotaxis assays and the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined. In addition, we evaluated RT-PCR expressions of selected oxidative stress and antioxidant mRNA genes (HSP27, 70, and 83, SOD, Nrf-2, MAPK2, and catalase). Furthermore, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined. VCH exposure impaired negative geotaxic behavior and induced the mRNA of SOD, Nrf-2, and MAPK2 genes expressions. There were increases in catalase and ROS production, as well as inhibitions of GST, δ-ALA-D, and AChE activities (P<0.05). Our results suggest that the VCH mechanism of toxicity is associated with oxidative damage, as evidenced by the alteration in the oxidative stress-antioxidant balance, and possible neurotoxic consequences due to decreased AChE activity, and impairments in negative geotaxic behavior. Thus, we conclude that D. melanogaster is a useful model for investigating the toxicity of VCH exposure, and here, we have provided further insights on the mechanism of VCH-induced toxicity.' publications.doi='10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.03.014' publications.firstAuthor='Abolaji Amos Olalekan' publications.id=1164844 publications.issue=None publications.journal='Free Radic.

As catabolic enzymes they contribute significantly to the regulation of cellular nucleotide levels; misregulation of nucleotide metabolism and nucleotidase deficiencies are associated with a number of diseases. The seven human 5'-nucleotidases differ with respect to substrate specificity and cellular localization. Recently, the novel cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase III-like protein, or cN-IIIB, has been characterized in human and Drosophila. cN-IIIB exhibits a strong substrate preference for the modified nucleotide 7-methylguanosine monophosphate but the structural reason for this preference was unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of cN-IIIB from Drosophila melanogaster bound to the reaction products 7-methylguanosine or cytidine. The structural data reveal that the cytosine- and 7-methylguanine moieties of the products are stacked between two aromatic residues in a coplanar but off-centered position. 7-methylguanosine is specifically bound through π-π interactions and distinguished from unmodified guanosine by additional cation-π coulomb interactions between the aromatic side chains and the positively charged 7-methylguanine. Notably, the base is further stabilized by T-shaped edge-to-face stacking of an additional tryptophan packing perpendicularly against the purine ring and forming, together with the other aromates, an aromatic slot. The structural data in combination with site-directed mutagenesis experiments reveal the molecular basis for the broad substrate specificity of cN-IIIB but also explain the substrate preference for 7-methylguanosine monophosphate. Analyzing the substrate specificities of cN-IIIB and the main pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase cN-IIIA by mutagenesis studies, we show that cN-IIIA dephosphorylates the purine m7GMP as well, hence redefining its substrate spectrum. Docking calculations with cN-IIIA and m7GMP as well as biochemical data reveal that Asn69 does not generally exclude the turnover of purine substrates thus correcting previous suggestions.\" publications.doi='10.1371/journal.pone.0090915' publications.firstAuthor='Monecke Thomas' publications.id=1988552 publications.issue='3' publications.journal='PLoS ONE' publications.month=None publications.pages='e90915' publications.pubMedId='24603684' publications.title=\"Crystal structures of the novel cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase IIIB explain its preference for m7GMP.\" publications.volume='9' publications.year=2014\n"
